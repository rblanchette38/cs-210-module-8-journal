Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project the objective was to develop a program to help a local business in item counting and record keeping for the amount of product they sell.  Developing an easy to use program for calling on previously entered data.  
the benefit of this project is that the enduser will be able to keep track of supply and demand on items for future inventory purposes.

What did you do particularly well?
In this project I felt I had a better understanding of some of the commands to develop code easier.  Previous module work on using specific commands helped with developing the code for this project.  where I had struggled previously, I found I could better understand program commands.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There is much I still need to learn with C++.  I continously would make errors and find I could not understand what was causing them.  Eventually after much guesswork I would uncover what I was doing wrong.  It would be a great benefit to me, if I were able to quickly understand 
the errors I was making, and correct them.  I currently feel like I am spending more time than I should on simple mistakes and not seeing them easily.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Writing code for the output of code was a struggle for me.  I found success after a while, but it seemed like I would continously write the code that should work, only for it to result in an error.  Small mistakes from syntax to using the wrong commands are things I have trouble spotting.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
With all the courses I have taken so far I have found that the greatest takeaway is the continued effort of thinking like a programmer.  In this project seeing how commands turn into the menu and calling data is a way I can visualize the code in action.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Developing code to prompt user input and calling the data related to that input allows for easy readability.  The .txt file provides the input data values, so editting this would allow for adaptability.
